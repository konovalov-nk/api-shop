## Simple Shop API

This is a part of a project I did from [May 21st to June 7th, 2018](https://www.quora.com/What-can-a-one-man-web-developer-produce/answer/Nikolay-Konovalov-1).

It is a simple back-end for e-commerce website using Rails (REST API), PostgreSQL, `rspec`, a few things from [12-factor](https://12factor.net/) (such as `.env` configuration files). For a full list, see [Built with](#built-with).
